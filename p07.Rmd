#The goal is to find the most common crime and plot the descriptions
#data:reports of crimes in Chicago

### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
Chicago_Crime_Data <- read_csv("Chicago_Crime_Data.csv")
ChiCrime <- Chicago_Crime_Data
View(ChiCrime)
```

### Find the most common types (top 10) of crime in Chicago and plot them

```{crime-type}
ChiCrime %>% 
  drop_na %>%
  group_by(PRIMARY_TYPE) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    percent = count / nrow(.) * 100
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(count), desc(PRIMARY_TYPE)) %>%
  head(10)
```
#Theft is most common crime. Next, a frequency plot of these theft descriptions

```{r description-plot}
ChiCrime %>% 
 filter(PRIMARY_TYPE == "THEFT") %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = DESCRIPTION)) + geom_bar(fill = "Steel Blue") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + labs(title = "Frequency of Types of Theft in Chicago", y = "Frequency")
