#The goal is to look at the distribution of tissue types with gene mutations
#data: gene mutations

```{r data-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
gene <- read_csv("gene.csv")
glimpse(gene)
summary(gene)
#Plot of the frequency of tissue types
gene %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Tissue, fill = Tissue)) + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Gene Mutations by Tissue Type", x = "Tissue", y = "Frequency")
#Comparison of these distributions faceted by evidence type
 gene %>% 
          ggplot(aes(x = Tissue, fill = Tissue)) + 
          geom_bar() + 
          facet_wrap(~GDR, scales = "free_y") +
          theme(axis.text.x=element_blank()) +
          labs(title = "Gene Mutations by Tissue Type by Strength of Evidence", 
               y = "Frequency")
 
 #This reveal some interesting differences. In the definitive evidence category, there are very few blood-related genes but disproportionately significant amount of lung-related genes. This is inversely reflected in the "no evidence" category.
